## Vietnamese UI font source

The requested `Baloo2-ExtraBold` and `Nunito-Bold` TMP assets use the installed
Noto Sans ExtraBold and Noto Sans Bold font files as project-compatible local
fallback sources because Baloo 2 and Nunito were not installed in the build
environment. Noto Sans is distributed under the SIL Open Font License 1.1.
The asset filenames describe their intended UI roles; they do not claim that
the embedded font face is Baloo 2 or Nunito. The role assets link to a
project-owned `VietnameseFallback` TMP asset carrying the required UI glyph
set because some broad-range codepoints are not covered directly by the role
assets.

## Character sprites

Every character in Sprint, Football and Volleyball is a project-generated flat cartoon
sprite in PE uniform (white T-shirt, navy track pants, sneakers), made with image
generation from the "Chạy trốn thể chất" art brief and cut to 192 × 256 RGBA PNGs on
2026-10-05. They replace the Kenney Toon Characters poses under the same file names, so
folder names and pose names are kept from that pack. `MaleAdventurer` is the player in
every minigame and is never tinted.

| Project folder | Character | Roles |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `Characters/MaleAdventurer/` | Anh Khoá Trên (main hero) | Player in Sprint, Football and Volleyball |
| `Characters/MalePerson/` | Tân Thủ | Sprint rival (lane 1), Football goalkeeper |
| `Characters/FemalePerson/` | Mai Toang | Sprint rival (lane 3) |
| `Characters/FemaleAdventurer/` | Cô Thể Chất (PE teacher) | Sprint rival (lane 4), Volleyball opponent |

Each folder holds the same poses: `idle run0 run1 run2 hit cheer0 cheer1 fallDown back
climb0 climb1 hurt duck hold jump attack1 slide fall`.

## Project-generated Volleyball art

The court, net, court lines, ball and ball/marker shadow in `MG_Volleyball` are flat shapes
authored by this project: the scene configurator draws the court from coloured quads and
generates `Art/Environments/Volleyball/{Ball,Shadow,Pixel}.png` procedurally. No third-party
art is used there; the athletes are the project character sprites (see above).

## Project-generated report demo art

The game logo mark, Android icon, home illustration, and Sprint environment
layers were generated specifically for this project with OpenAI image
generation on 2026-09-05. The logo intentionally contains no baked text;
Unity renders the exact Vietnamese product title with TextMeshPro.
